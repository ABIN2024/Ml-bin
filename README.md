# Ml-bin
An ML model is trained by exposing it to a diverse dataset, which includes multiple instances of objects that the system might encounter as waste. The purpose is to enable the model to recognize and categorize items as trash. Following the training phase, the ML model is seamlessly incorporated into the Pi system, empowering it to generate real-time decisions by processing input data from the Camera module and comparing it to the learned patterns within the dataset. This integration enables the micro-controlled smart dustbin to autonomously identify and classify objects as trash, thereby facilitating timely and responsive actions based on the environmental input received from the camera.
